LcfTrans
========

LcfTrans is a small tool to extract strings out of RPG Maker 2000 and 2003
database (LSD) and map files (LMU). These strings are written to a po
translation file and can be translated using any tool supporting the po format
(e.g. Poedit).

Writing the translation back into the RPG Maker files is currently *NOT*
supported.

LcfTrans is part of the EasyRPG Project.
